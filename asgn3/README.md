This program will be the middleman between client requests and as many servers as you want. It will take these requests and prioritize a server to send it to every 5 seconds. This in theory should reduce the load for one particular server as it does not need to handle all requests. This also allows for servers to go down and the requests to still be processed by the remaining servers.

This is not fully functional and sometimes gets into endless loops during puts, and I do not know why. 

We have finally made it to the end of the year and HOLY this class has been by far the most difficult I have ever taken. I must have a combine of 100+ hours on the past 3 assignments alone WOW.

I was not able to fully finish this assignment in time but gave it my all please spare me lol.

BTW loved this class and it truly pushed me to my breaking point and even a little more.
